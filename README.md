### Overview
A ride-sharing company wants to implement a dynamic pricing strategy to optimize fares based on real-time market conditions. The company only uses ride duration to decide ride fares currently. The company aims to leverage data-driven techniques to analyze historical data and develop a predictive model that can dynamically adjust prices in response to changing factors.

### Dataset
The dataset provided for this project contains historical ride data and includes features such as the number of riders, number of drivers, location category, customer loyalty status, number of past rides, average ratings, time of booking, vehicle type, expected ride duration, and historical cost of the rides. These features will serve as the basis for developing the dynamic pricing model. You can download the data from [**Kaggle Here**](#https://statso.io/dynamic-pricing-case-study/).

### Objectives
1. Develop a predictive model that accurately estimates optimal fares for rides based on real-time market conditions and historical data.
2. Investigate the impact of various factors such as demand patterns, supply availability, and customer attributes on ride fares.
3. Implement a dynamic pricing strategy that adjusts fares in response to changing factors to maximize revenue and customer satisfaction.

### Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather comprehensive datasets and preprocess them by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features and potentially create new ones to enhance the predictive power of the model, considering factors such as demand patterns and supply availability.
3. **Model Selection**: Explore various machine learning algorithms, including regression and ensemble methods, to identify the optimal model for dynamic pricing prediction.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train the selected model on the preprocessed dataset and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error and root mean squared error.
5. **Dynamic Pricing Implementation**: Implement the trained model to dynamically adjust fares in real-time based on changing market conditions, demand patterns, and supply availability, ensuring optimal pricing for each ride.
