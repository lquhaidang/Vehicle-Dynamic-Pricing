# Vehicle Dynamic Pricing Description:

In this project I will:

- Analyzed ride-sharing data to develop a dynamic pricing model based on demand and supply.

- Engineered features capturing the relationship between riders, drivers, and ride duration.

- Evaluated multiple regression models and selected a tuned CatBoostRegressor for optimal performance.

- Built functions for price prediction and deployed the model with a StandardScaler.
